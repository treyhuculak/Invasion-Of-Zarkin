# Invasion of Zarkin

This is a game I made back in high school using the Unity engine. It is a space game where you control a spaceship by using the "W" and "S" keys to move forward
and backward in relation to your mouse. There are power-ups, different skins for your spaceship, multiple types of enemies and levels, sound effects etc.

Unfortunately because of how long ago I made the game, I cannot find any of the source files for this game or others I have created over the years, but was fortunate enough to find the 
playable game files.

Enjoy!
